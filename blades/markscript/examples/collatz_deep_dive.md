# CollatzDeepDive — Sequence Explorer & Conjecture Verifier

> The Collatz conjecture: every positive integer eventually reaches 1 under
> the map `n → n/2 (if even)` or `n → 3n+1 (if odd)`.
> Computed entirely in markscript mini-language. No external math.
> Exercises: complex while loops, parity detection via equality workaround,
> sequence length tracking, max-value tracking.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| MaxNumber | 100 |
| VerifyAll | 1 |
| LongestRun | 1 |

## detect_even — Parity via repeated subtraction

```markscript
# Even/odd detection without modulo operator:
# Repeatedly subtract 2 from n and check if we hit 0 or 1
# If we reach 0, n is even. If we reach 1, n is odd.
```

---

## verify_conjecture — Check every number up to MaxNumber

```markscript
let max_n = 100
let start = 2
let longest_seq = 0
let longest_n = 0
let total_steps = 0

print("=== Collatz Conjecture Verification up to " + str(max_n) + " ===")

        let p = n
        let is_even = 0
        let found_p = 0

        # Parity check: subtract 2 from copy until < 2
        # If result is 0: even. If result is 1: odd.
        # (We use the equality workaround here)
        let parity_test_val = n

            # The while condition checks > 1, so we must exit
            # We'll set to 0 or 1 and the while check handles it

        if parity_test_val > 0:
            # n is odd: 3n + 1
            n = n * 3 + 1
        else:
            # n is even: n / 2
            n = n / 2

        steps = steps + 1

        # Track max value reached
        if n > max_val:
            max_val = n

    start = start + 1

```

print("=== Collatz Report ===")
