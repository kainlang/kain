# Firewall

Markscript firewall management — packet filtering rules, port management, and policy control.
Dispatches through the IVT to netsh (Windows) or iptables (Linux) for all operations.

let port = 80
let proto = "TCP"
push("netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"" + name + "\" dir=in action=allow protocol=" + proto + " localport=" + port)
call("run")
```

---

## deny

Add a deny rule for a specific port and protocol.

> run "netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"Block Telnet\" dir=in action=block protocol=TCP localport=23"

```markscript
# Block inbound traffic on a port
let name = "Block Telnet"
let port = 23
