# Uniq

MarkScript duplicate detection — filter, count, report repeated lines.
Wraps `uniq` via the IVT for adjacent duplicate operations.

---

## sorted_unique

> run "sort file.txt | uniq"

```markscript
let file = "words.txt"
push("sort " + file + " | uniq")
call("run")
# globally unique lines
```

---

## count

Count occurrences of each unique line.

> run "uniq -c file.txt"

```markscript
let file = "visits.log"
push("uniq -c " + file)
call("run")
# "   42 Monday"
```

---

## sorted_count

call("run")
# sorted by frequency, highest first
```

---

## repeated

---

## all_repeated

---

## unique_only

---

## skip_fields
