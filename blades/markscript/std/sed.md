# Sed

MarkScript stream editor — search, replace, insert, delete lines.
Wraps `sed` via the IVT for text transformations.

---

## substitute

Replace first occurrence of a pattern per line.

> run "sed 's/old/new/' file.txt"

```markscript
let old = "foo"
let new = "bar"
let file = "data.txt"
push("sed 's/" + old + "/" + new + "/' " + file)
call("run")
# first match per line replaced
```

---

## substitute_all

Replace all occurrences of a pattern on each line (global).

> run "sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt"

```markscript
let old = "  "
let new = " "
let file = "spaced.txt"
push("sed 's/" + old + "/" + new + "/g' " + file)
call("run")
# all matches on each line replaced
```

---

## delete_line

Delete lines matching a pattern.

> run "sed '/pattern/d' file.txt"

## multiple_edits

Apply multiple sed expressions.
