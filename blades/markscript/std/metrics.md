# Metrics

MarkScript evaluation metrics — quantifying model performance through
classification, regression, and clustering metrics. Dispatches to
Python's `scikit-learn` metrics module.

## accuracy

Compute classification accuracy (fraction of correct predictions).

> run "python -c \"from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score; y_true=[0,1,0,1,0,1]; y_pred=[0,1,0,0,0,1]; print(accuracy_score(y_true,y_pred))\""

```markscript
let y_true = [0 1 0 1 0 1]
let y_pred = [0 1 0 0 0 1]
# 5 correct out of 6
let accuracy = 0.833
```

---

## precision

Compute precision: TP / (TP + FP).

> run "python -c \"from sklearn.metrics import precision_score; y_true=[0,1,0,1,0,1]; y_pred=[0,1,0,0,1,1]; print(precision_score(y_true,y_pred))\""

```markscript
let y_true = [0 1 0 1 0 1]
let y_pred = [0 1 0 0 1 1]
# TP=2, FP=1 → 2/3
let precision = 0.667
```

---

Compute recall: TP / (TP + FN).

> run "python -c \"from sklearn.metrics import recall_score; y_true=[0,1,0,1,0,1]; y_pred=[0,1,0,0,1,1]; print(recall_score(y_true,y_pred))\""

```markscript
let y_true = [0 1 0 1 0 1]
let y_pred = [0 1 0 0 1 1]

```markscript
let y_true = [0 1 0 1 0 1]
let y_pred = [0 1 0 0 1 1]
# 2 * (prec * rec) / (prec + rec)

```markscript
let y_true = [3 5 7 9]
let y_pred = [2.8 5.2 7.1 8.7]
# MAE = (|3-2.8| + |5-5.2| + |7-7.1| + |9-8.7|) / 4

```markscript
let y_true = [3 5 7 9]
let y_pred = [2.8 5.2 7.1 8.7]
# MSE = ((3-2.8)^2 + (5-5.2)^2 + (7-7.1)^2 + (9-8.7)^2) / 4
# MSE = (0.04 + 0.04 + 0.01 + 0.09) / 4
let mse = 0.045
```

```markscript
let y_true = [3 5 7 9]
let y_pred = [3.1 5.0 6.9 9.2]

# [[0.9 0.1]  [0.2 0.8]  [0.8 0.2]  [0.1 0.9]]
let log_loss = 0.226
# lower is better (perfect = 0)

## silhouette_score

Compute the mean silhouette coefficient for cluster quality.

> run "python -c \"from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score; from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs; X,y=make_blobs(n_samples=100,n_features=2,centers=3,random_state=0); print(silhouette_score(X,y))\""

```markscript
let n_clusters = 3
let n_samples = 100
# silhouette_score = 0.68
# range: -1 (bad) to 1 (excellent)
# >0.5 indicates reasonable cluster separation

Compute the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) for cluster agreement.
